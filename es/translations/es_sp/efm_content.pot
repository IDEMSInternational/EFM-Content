"As an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n\n"
"Why does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions."

Then 1 would happen 10 / 18 of the time and 2 would happen 8 / 18 of the time. If you put both tokens on 1, you would need to get a 1 and then a 1 to win after two rolls.

What is causing this symmetry is that for every solution, there is another solution created by subtracting all the numbers from 7 (or from 10 for the nine circle puzzle). A little calculating will show that this symmetry takes a puzzle with sum SUM and creates a new one with sum (21 - SUM) (or 40 - SUM for the nine circle puzzle).\n\n"

"All these observations save a tremendous amount of work. We only need to look at SUM equal to 9 and 10, and we only need to have the corners in increasing order. If SUM is 9, then C-SUM = 3 x 9 - 21 = 6, so the trio is 1, 2, and 3. If SUM is 10, then a + b + c = 3 x 10 - 21 = 9.

For example, 32 petals is four 7’s and one 4, and it is also eight 4’s.\n\n"

For example, verify an item weighs 3 units by putting it with a 4-unit weight and see that it balances with a 7-unit weight.

What is causing the duplication is that the Fibonacci rule creates more than one way to write the Fibonacci numbers in terms of themselves - for example, 2 = 1 + 1 and 8 = 5 + 3. The way to fix this problem is to insist that you cannot use two Fibonacci numbers that are neighbors of each other in the sequence. When you add that restriction, the only way to get 10 is 2 + 8."

"Suppose you have a composite number. We want to show that this number will have an X under it. Being composite, it is divisible by some number, n, between 1 and that number. If n is a prime, then our composite number would have an X under it from n being an earlier prime. If n is not a prime, then it has an X under it from some earlier prime, call it p. Now, p evenly divides n and n evenly divides our new number, so p must divide our new number. Consequently, when marking the multiples of p, an X would have been placed under our new number.\n\n"
"b) When you are placing X’s for the multiples of a prime, there are some numbers that already have an X from an earlier prime. When does that happen and when doesn’t it happen?\n\n"
"Let’s look at the multiples of 5 in the sieve above. The multiples 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are already crossed out. Only 5 x 5 is new. This happens because 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are all multiples of 2 and 3, earlier primes. If we want to put X’s in fresh places, we must multiply 5 by numbers that only have prime factors that are 5 and above. Because it is a little tedious to keep track of all that, what some people do is only cross out odd multiples and leave it at that.\n\n"
"c) For this sieve, what was the last prime that had a useful new X in its row?\n\n"
"In this sieve, the primes with useful X’s are 2, 3, and 5. The multiples of 7 and 11 were all old X’s. If you look at the answer to the last question, you will see the answer here. The only way to get new X’s is to multiply a prime by primes bigger than or equal to itself. Once we reach a prime like 7 where 7 x 7 > 25, we do not need to check it. So, we only need to check primes whose square is smaller than or equal to the last number.\n\n"
"d) If you were given a number, say 53, which primes would you need to divide it by to see that it is prime? \n\n"
"From the answer to the last question, we only need to check primes whose square is less than or equal to 53. Those primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7 – none of these divides 53 evenly, so 53 must be prime!"

You know what’s coming – look at simpler tables first to look for patterns - when this idea becomes automatic for your child, this will serve them well for the rest of their lives!\n\n"
"The simplest tables are 1 by n, and they are easy to understand. Playing with a few values of n, the pattern emerges quickly. It is easy to undervalue a simple result like this; however, any completely understood result is to be celebrated, and this result will lead to others.\n\n"
"**Result** 1 by n table: The ball will take n-1 bounces. The ball will end up in the bottom right corner if n is even and in the upper right corner if n is odd.\n\n"

An observant experimenter will notice that a 2 by 4 table behaves just like a 1 by 2 table, and a 2 by 6 table just like a 1 by 3. This quickly generalizes to the next result.\n\n"
"**Result** A 2 by 2xn table behaves just like a 1 by n table.\n\n"
"Why is this? What is going on? This is a mathematical process to instill in your child – look for patterns and then seek to understand them, and with that new understanding extend your earlier results.\n\n"
"What is going on is that the bounces on a table do not change if you enlarge both dimensions by the same factor. When that is done, the table is bigger but the geometry is the same. In geometry terms, the two tables are said to be “similar.” \n\n"
"**Result** A kxm by kxn table behaves exactly like an m by n table.\n\n"
"We have gotten here in little steps, but this is a BIG result. It means we can start our analysis on any table by first removing any common factor.\n\n"
"Resuming where we left off for 2 by n tables. We understand what happens when n is even, but what happens when n is odd? What happens for 2 by n for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on? The pattern quickly becomes easy to see.\n\n"

"Lots of progress is being made. Playing with more examples leads to some more patterns.\n\n"

If n is odd, a 4 by n table has n + 2 bounces and ends in the upper left corner. If n is not a multiple of 5, a 5 by n table has n+3 bounces and ends up in the upper right corner when n is odd and lower right corner when n is even.\n\n"

"Although there are other ways to understand this situation, as sometimes happens, what makes this problem much easier to understand is a new idea. It might not occur to you, but once you see it you will probably be amazed. The idea is to unfold the table so that the ball can go in a straight line!

"14 - 2/20 (from 7 and 14)\n"
"15 - 1/20 (from 15)\n"

"19 - 1/20 (from 19)\n"
"20 - 3/20 (from 5, 10, and 20)\n\n"
"Clearly the best numbers to use are multiples of 16, 12, and 20. A simple strategy is to use the five numbers: 32, 64, 24, 48, and 40. These numbers will not always win, but they should do very well for you over time."
